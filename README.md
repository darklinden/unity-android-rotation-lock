unity-android-rotation-lock
===========================

A small Unity plugin that lets you access an Android device's rotation lock setting.

Simply import the package under "UnityPackage" and use the function exposed in AndroidRotationLockUtil.cs
to check the device's rotation lock setting on awake and on resume. The sample project contains a script
with an idea of how to do this.
